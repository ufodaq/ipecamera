Bugs 
====
 1. For IPECamera, shall we limit DMA packet size to xdma_packet_lenght register
 additionally to size of memory page?

High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Serialize access to the registers across applications
 2. Protect kmem_entries in the driver using spinlock
 3. CMake build system
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement software registers (stored in kernel-memory)
 2. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
 3. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 4. Support writting a data from a binary file in cli
 5. Use bus-addresses instead of physcial addresses for DMA 
 6. Instead of waiting in the end of trigger function to satisfy delay required
    between consequent triggers, measure the timestamp when next trigger is 
    allowed and check it in the beginning of the trigger function.
 
Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. XML configurations describing registers (and DMA engines?)
 2. Access register/bank lookups using hash tables
 3. Support for Network Registers and Network DMA
 4. Define a syntax for register dependencies / delays (?)
