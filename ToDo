High Priority (we would need it for IPE Camera)
=============
 1. Serialize access to the registers across applications
 2. Protect kmem_entries in the driver using spinlock
 3. CMake build system
 
Normal Priority (it would make just few things a bit easier)
===============
 1. Implement software registers (stored in kernel-memory)
 2. Support FIFO reads/writes from/to registers
 3. Provide OR and AND operations on registers in cli
 
Low Priority (only as generalization for other projects)
============
 1. XML configurations describing registers (and DMA engines?)
 2. Access register/bank lookups using hash tables
