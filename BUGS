IPECamera Hardware Bugs
=======================
 1. Strange sequence writting CMOSIS registers
 2. Extra 8 byte padding in the end of frames
 3. Solve the conflict between DMA packet_length register and FPGA registers
 4. Some frame requests are lost

Incomplete Frames
-----------------
 If I'm trying to stream the data, the camera from time to time returns 
 incomplete frames. The provided part of the frame is coherent. But instead 
 of at least 3063824 bytes (just full frame without padding, normally I get 
 more due to the padding) I get only 3063808 bytes. This number 3063808 looks 
 like to be constant.

 If I send another frame request, however, it looks I got the missing data with 
 the next frame.
