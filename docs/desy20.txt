Camera: 3840x5120
======
 - 5120 = 16 channels of 320 pixels each.
    * In fact two lines returned simultaneously (in each payload). So, there is 8 channels per line and 640 payloads are transferred to complete 2 lines.
    * Actually, 641. There is always 1 extra payload which is just skipped in libufodecode (starting with C0)
    * Actually, 1 (last) payload is missing for the first two rows. So, total number of payloads is (3840/2) * (640 + 1) - 32

 - Limitations
    * Due to encoding, ROI should always start at even line and include even number of lines

    

Triggering
==========
 There is 2 bits of control register responsible for external triggering
    bit 16 (from 1): enables external triggering (should be 1)
    bit 15 (from 1): sets edge type of triggering (should be 1)

 - Start external triggering
    pci -w control 0x8000C201
 - Stop external triggering
    pci -w control 0x80008201


Repeating line bug
==================
 - Happening with manual triggering, but do not happen in external trigger mode
